Building Mach for everyone If Mach engine only benefits people interested in using that engine, and not the broader Zig (and even gamedev) community I would consider that a total failure.
Whether you&rsquo;re interested in using all of Mach, just some of it with your own engine / project, or just the tools/ideas we develop in the future (with Unity, Unreal, etc.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/2021/mach-engine-the-future-of-graphics-with-zig/>Mach Engine: The future of graphics (with Zig)</a></h3><a class=summary href=/2021/mach-engine-the-future-of-graphics-with-zig/><p>In the coming months, we&rsquo;ll begin to have truly cross-platform low-level graphics, with the ability to cross compile GPU-accelerated applications written in Zig from any OS and deploy to desktop, mobile, and (in the future) web.
Mach engine I&rsquo;ve been working on Mach Engine for about 4 months now, although it as a project is many years in the making, and I believe in the next 4-6 months we&rsquo;ll have completion of the first key milestone: truly cross platform graphics and seamless cross compilation.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/2021/i-write-code-100-hours-a-week/>I write code 100 hours/week, here's why I probably won't stop</a></h3><a class=summary href=/2021/i-write-code-100-hours-a-week/><p>I write code 100 hours/week. I&rsquo;ve done so for the last 2 years and, excluding a life-altering event (illness?) I probably won&rsquo;t stop.
The average week I typically spend around:
48h/week @ day job, Sourcegraph, building developer tools 55h/week coding in Zig 7h/day sleeping 9h/week caring for self, chores, etc. 5h/week games or chatting with friends Sometimes coding drops to around 80h/week if I feel I need more sleep, time for something else, or if I&rsquo;m just not feeling it.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/2021/unicode-data-file-compression/>Unicode data file compression: achieving 40-70% reduction over gzip alone</a></h3><a class=summary href=/2021/unicode-data-file-compression/><p>A little story about how writing a domain-specific compression algorithm in a few days can sometimes yield big benefits, why it&rsquo;s sometimes worth giving it a shot, and how to tell when you should try. Note: this is about Unicode spec data files, not general purpose text compression.
Background Problem Investigation Binary encoding? Differential encoding/compression? Go implementation Zig implementation Differential encoding state machine A stream of op codes Iteratively finding the most lucrative opcodes A stream of opcodes for a state machine: a natural progression from a binary format?</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/2021/unicode-sorting-why-browsers-added-special-emoji-matching/>Unicode sorting is hard & why browsers added special emoji matching to regexp</a></h3><a class=summary href=/2021/unicode-sorting-why-browsers-added-special-emoji-matching/><p>As I work on Zorex, an omnipotent regexp engine I have stumbled into a world of tales about why Unicode text sorting is so annoying in the modern day. Let&rsquo;s talk about that.
Why ASCII sorting is not enough Twitter&rsquo;s emoji problem - or when Unicode locale-aware sorting Really Mattersâ„¢ Browsers added special emoji matching to regexp Language comparison JavaScript Collator sorting is not guaranteed across browsers Go sort.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/2021/increasing-my-contribution-to-zig-to-200-a-month/>My game development journey & why I'm increasing my contribution to Zig to $200/mo</a></h3><a class=summary href=/2021/increasing-my-contribution-to-zig-to-200-a-month/><p>Today, I increased my monthly donation to Zig to $200 a month. Before Zig, I have not contributed financially to any open source project.
Before I can explain why I am so extremely excited about the Zig programming language and its community, I need to explain where I come from.
I grew up playing Linux games like Mania Drive It wasn&rsquo;t long before I found that the Mania Drive game engine was open-source.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/2021/zig-parser-combinators-and-why-theyre-awesome/>Zig, Parser Combinators - and Why They're Awesome</a></h3><a class=summary href=/2021/zig-parser-combinators-and-why-theyre-awesome/><p>In this article we will be exploring what parser combinators are, what runtime parser generation is - why they&rsquo;re useful, and then walking through a Zig implementation of them.
What are parser combinators? Why are parser combinators useful? Going deeper: runtime parser generation A note about traditional regex engines Implementing the Parser interface Compile-time vs. run-time The parser interface Zig generics are provided via type parameters Zig runtime interfaces Type parameters Errors the Parser interface can produce Our first Parser What actually is a &ldquo;Reader&rdquo;?</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/2021/postgres-regex-search-over-10000-github-repositories/>Postgres regex search over 10,000 GitHub repositories (using only a Macbook)</a></h3><a class=summary href=/2021/postgres-regex-search-over-10000-github-repositories/><p>In this article, we share empirical measurements from our experiments in using Postgres to index and search over 10,000 top GitHub repositories using pg_trgm on only a Macbook.
This is a follow up to &ldquo;Postgres Trigram search learnings&rdquo;, in which we shared several learnings and beliefs about trying to use Postgres Trigram indexes as an alterative to Google&rsquo;s Zoekt (&ldquo;Fast trigram based code search&rdquo;).
We share our results, as well as the exact steps we performed, scripts, and lists of the top 20,000 repositories by stars/language on GitHub so you can reproduce the results yourself should you desire.</p></a></p><p><h3><a class=title href=/2021/postgres-trigram-search-learnings/>Postgres Trigram search learnings</a></h3><a class=summary href=/2021/postgres-trigram-search-learnings/><p>In this article I talk about learnings I have from trying to use pg_trgm as the backend for a search engine, Tridex, which aims to be a competitor to Google&rsquo;s Zoekt (&ldquo;Fast trigram based code search&rdquo;)
Background I work @ Sourcegraph, which provides code search, code intelligence, and other developer tooling. (If you&rsquo;re one of my Sourcegraph co-workers, hey! Hexops is the name of my GitHub organization for after-hours experiments and what I hope will one day in the distant future become a successful game development company.</p></a></p></div><div class=footer><div class=row-1><a href=https://hexops.com/privacy>Privacy matters</a>
