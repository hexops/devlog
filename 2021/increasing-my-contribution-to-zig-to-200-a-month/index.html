Me and my siblings in our early teens easily spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in Mania Drive.</p><p>In retrospect it has quite bad graphics, physics, game-play mechanics, etc. But it was customizable! There was a simple tile-based level editor. We would spend days building the most confusing, crazy, impossible maps to beat so we could challenge each other. We would play it all night.</p><p>Obsession over this game led to even more modding: the discovery of <a href=https://www.blender.org>Blender</a> meant we could create even more custom maps than in the limited tile-based map editor. Although the Blender UI was pretty rough back then:</p><img class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/114266230-073f2180-99aa-11eb-9196-5c546fe71fb8.png><h2 id=it-wasnt-long-before-i-found-that-the-mania-drive-game-engine-was-open-source>It wasn&rsquo;t long before I found that the Mania Drive game engine was open-source.</h2><p><a href=http://memak.raydium.org/index.php>Raydium</a>, the C game engine behind Mania Drive, is still around today - one of the beauties of open source software! At the time, the things about it that just blew my mind were:</p><ul><li>It supported scripting through PHP! I had used PHP a lot with LAMP stacks, so the idea that I could script the engine in PHP was <em>mind blowing to now 14-year old me.</em></li><li>2 years later, I got an iPod touch and the Raydium developers had just posted a demo video showing the engine running on the iPhone. 16 year old me thought this was <em>literally</em> the coolest thing ever, albeit immensely disappointed I did not have a Mac to build it for my iPod:</li></ul><iframe width=720 height=480 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wcPfxr9BgA4 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2 id=i-was-so-infatuated-with-this-game-engine-i-convinced-my-dads-coworkers-to-pay-me-to-build-them-a-virtual-meeting-world>I was so infatuated with this game engine, I convinced my dad&rsquo;s coworkers to pay me to build them a virtual meeting world</h2><p>My dad was running one of his many startups at the time - it had some momentum behind it, basically a platform like Ebay but for selling services instead of goods. Several of his work friends were funding it with significant amounts of their own money.</p><p>Unfortunately for them, they spent most of their focus on business operations than actually getting a product out the door. Lucky for me, however, this meant they had came across Sun&rsquo;s <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Wonderland>Project Wonderland</a> - the delightfully terrible 3D virtual workplace of the future (or so Sun thought, before they had to sell to Oracle.) It was <em>terrible,</em> barely a good demo:</p><img class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/114258853-625b1f00-997e-11eb-959d-15a2cdafae9c.png><p>It required something like 32 CPUs and 64G of memory to run the server for just 8 players - no small feat back in 2010! The client was laggy, there were virtual whiteboards you could draw on but everything was slow. Even its VOIP feature was glitchy - although quite novel at the time. It was all around <em>a terrible experience.</em></p><p>16-year-old me convinced my dad and his coworkers to instead pay me to build them a better version: one using Raydium, C - and PHP.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before I had some amateur copy of Project Wonderland - ironically better than Sun&rsquo;s in <em>many aspects</em> - and surely worse in others. It even had a client auto-updater built with wxWidgets and Python (it just shelled out to an <code>svn</code> client to download the latest copy of the game, hah!)</p><h2 id=but-the-game-kept-crashing-at-random-and-i-had-no-idea-why>But the game kept crashing at random, and I had no idea why</h2><p>The truth was literally a 16-year old script kiddy copying and pasting C code from various demos of Raydium, without a care in the world for freeing memory or avoiding stack corruption.</p><pre><code>// Don't remove this print statement. Game will crash!
</code></pre><p>It was around this time that I began to really get into Python: it was simple, something I could really wrap my brain around, and it was powerful. I stumbled into cython and wrote OpenGL bindings - this time with more appreciation for memory management.</p><h2 id=panda3d-disneys-pythonc-game-engine>Panda3D: Disney&rsquo;s Python/C++ game engine</h2><p>Panda3D was the game engine Disney used to create Toontown Online and Pirates of the Carribean Online:</p><img class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/114259007-b31f4780-997f-11eb-9741-db4507dd820f.png>
<img class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/114259061-0db8a380-9980-11eb-8991-1f8443388cc3.png><p>It was written in C++, with automatic binding generation for Python. In fact, many portions of the engine were written in <em>just</em> Python and not usable from C++ at all. <a href=https://www.panda3d.org>They revamped their website site recently, so I guess it&rsquo;s still around.</a></p><h2 id=the-panda3d-game-engine-opened-new-doors-for-me>The Panda3D game engine opened new doors for me</h2><p>Discovering Panda3D opened new doors for me. At around 16-17 years old now, I was able to really get my first real taste of game development: I could write games in this &ndash; in Python &ndash; and <em>they wouldn&rsquo;t crash in ways that I couldn&rsquo;t understand.</em></p><p>Pretty soon, I had actual games in the works. I was starting to learn about why draw order matters - and how I had no understanding of mip-mapping:</p><img class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/114259274-8e2bd400-9981-11eb-905d-cd675c582f5b.png>
<img class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/114259299-bb788200-9981-11eb-97df-ad00c29a54c2.png><h2 id=i-began-to-prevail>I began to prevail</h2><p>At this point I had several, actually working games - I was proud of what I was working on, had multiplayer functionality hooked up to a MySQL database even.</p><img class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/114259396-7ef95600-9982-11eb-9e32-3b8edff3e67f.png><h2 id=but-my-limited-knowledge-hit-me-again>But my limited knowledge hit me again</h2><p>For my game, I wanted nothing more than for my friends to be able to chat with me using a chat box. The problem was, Panda3D&rsquo;s Python GUI library, DirectGUI, was just too slow at rendering text.</p><p>I tried everything I could, and even got to the point where I was asking on the forums if it was possible to draw a TextNode with multi-threading:</p><blockquote><p>Calls to TextNode.generate() are very expensive.</p><p>Is there a way for Panda to run all TextNode.generate() calls in a seperate thread? I’ve attempted doing it on my own using direct.stdpy.threading.Thread, only it causes dead locks, I would guess this is to my own lack of knowledge.</p><p>could anyone help me?</p></blockquote><p>I didn&rsquo;t get a response. I couldn&rsquo;t solve the issue. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t add a chat box to my games&rdquo; became a problem <em>I could not solve.</em></p><h2 id=learning-c>Learning C++</h2><p>I was at a point where I had rewritten most of Panda3D&rsquo;s UI components myself in Python (mind you, theirs <em>are</em> written in Python - you cannot use them from C++. I don&rsquo;t know why I did this.)</p><p>But I still needed a way to render text. I needed a way to make <code>TextNode.generate()</code> faster. Little did I know at the time that it was generating geometry from freetype and creating one draw call per text drawn - which is super slow, and did not help my naive usage of its API!</p><p>The harsh reality was that I didn&rsquo;t have anybody to teach me. I spent months trying to learn C++, but it is a beast (and &ldquo;Disney game engine C++&rdquo; is, of course, a flavor of C++ not found in books.) It wasn&rsquo;t something I could handle as 16-year-old kid without any real knowledge of low level languages.</p><p>In trying to learn C++, something became painfully clear to me:</p><blockquote><p><em>Having part of my application written in Python and part of it written in C++, two very different languages, was only great until I realized I <em>had</em> to dive into this large C++ code base and had no knowledge of it.</em></p></blockquote><p>I gave up.</p><h2 id=learning-go-writing-my-own-game-engine>Learning Go, writing my own game engine</h2><p>When Google announced Go, I heard about it very early on. At this time, they were still advertising it as a low-level systems language, an alternative to C, <em>a better C</em>. But more forgiving, because it had a garbage collector.</p><p>Coming from a predominantly Python background at the time, this sounded incredible to me: I could write a game engine in this and understand my code <em>end to end</em> and make sure there is no single piece that I do not understand.</p><p>I spent the next 4 years of my life, almost 100% full-time working on <a href=https://azul3d.org>Azul3D, a game engine in Go</a> - and spent only minimal time attending online community college on the weekends.</p><p>There was <em>so much</em> that I learned during this time, about software engineering, game engines, audio, input, math, image and audio codecs, blender plugins, file formats, physics, and working with other people (some cool things <a href=https://github.com/nwidger/nintengo>like a NES emulator came out of that</a>)</p><p>I learned an <em>immense</em> amount, but I had nothing to show for it aside from <a href=https://azul3d.org>a funny looking website</a> and some quite poor screenshots (to the dismay of every person I told.)</p><img class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/114266918-f42e5080-99ad-11eb-8cff-f9376f3bf0bb.png><h2 id=my-game-engine-appeared-on-hacker-news-2014>My game engine appeared on Hacker News (2014)</h2><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8151028">Someone posted it on Hacker News</a>, which was both exciting but also extremely depressing for me at the time. I took the feedback as statements that what I was doing <em>was wrong</em>, rather than as feedback about how to improve:</p><blockquote><p>The web site looks cool, but it sets off a whole bunch of red flags for me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the go programming language is not very suitable for games at all.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>if you truly need a performant graphics engine, it&rsquo;s going to be either C++, C or Rust anyway.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Azul3D is for programmers and doesn&rsquo;t provide GUI-editors.</p><p>So, you write your levels using a text editor? That&rsquo;s not for programmers, that&rsquo;s for people who hate themselves.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>No screenshots of the game at all?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Garbage collector FAQ isn&rsquo;t necessarily reassuring, since it seems to say &ldquo;go through the same hoops other GC gaming platforms push you through&rdquo;. Obligatory Rust gaming comment goes here.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>in Rust you have code without GC, but the compiler makes sure that everything is freed.</p></blockquote><p>I learned so much from this interaction:</p><ul><li>Being transparent about project status is important.</li><li>I shouldn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; screenshots of the project. I was worried people would judge what the engine is capable of based on bad programmer artwork: instead, they judged it for having none.</li><li>I should&rsquo;ve talked about the interesting parts more:<ul><li>Did you know there is a D* lite pathfinding algorithm that was used in one of the Mars rovers, is super simple, and handles dynamic terrains? Much nicer than A* and other variants.</li><li>What my vision for a game engine deeply integrated with Blender, and developer-first, would look like in practice.</li></ul></li><li>I frankly shouldn&rsquo;t have cared so much. I thought what I was doing was awesome, and I let others' viewpoints affect my own view of my work negatively.</li></ul><h2 id=joining-sourcegraph>Joining Sourcegraph</h2><p>It was around this time that I was basically deciding: <em>what would I do for a living?</em></p><p>Luckily, someone in the Go community (whom I&rsquo;d never talked to before) reached out to me and asked &ldquo;hey, what are you doing?&rdquo; - I told them I was in school, and left out the part where I was a college student living with parents, scraping by, and likely going grocery-store-part-time-job seeking soon.</p><img class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/114268396-b1707680-99b5-11eb-9038-c0b8d919b44f.png><p>I didn&rsquo;t come from a background that would lead me to believe I could make a living programming in Go, to the contrary my parents often warned me I couldn&rsquo;t and that I would need to go into Cisco network infrastructure instead.</p><p>I was told in blunt terms, I could scrape by doing what I love - or make a killing doing something I hate. My parents were mechanical engineers at aerospace companies (I&rsquo;ll let you guess which path they took.)</p><p>Bill&rsquo;s short ~20 minute conversation with me, quite literally changed my life in ways I couldn&rsquo;t have imagined. I often think about where I would be today had he not reached out to me, and I never quite knew how to reach back out and say thank you in a way that was as meaningful to him as what he did was for me.</p><h2 id=six-and-a-half-years-later-im-still-at-sourcegraph>Six and a half years later, I&rsquo;m still at Sourcegraph.</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve learned <em>so much</em> about startups, being a good engineer, management, business operations, cloud infrastructure, teamwork, communication, and so much more in the last six years I&rsquo;ve spent at Soucegraph. There are so many stories I have, and so many great people I have had the opportunity to work with because of it.</p><p>We grew from awkward little startup without a clear product, a tiny team, an uncertain future - into a sprawling metropolis with massive amounts of happy users, customers, $50m i series C funding, and have grown the team to over a hundred people all over the world. I have played a key role in that, and continue to this day.</p><p>A passion for making games as a kid, turned into a passion for making developer tools all around better. I still have much to do here.</p><h2 id=but-im-still-a-game-developer-at-heart>But I&rsquo;m still a game developer at heart</h2><p>If there&rsquo;s one thing I return to <em>regularly</em>, <em>consistently</em>, and <em>frequently</em> despite working a demanding job at a startup - it&rsquo;s game development. And you&rsquo;re going to hear a lot more about that soon.</p><p>Since March of last year, I began basically working two jobs: every day after I sign off from work at Sourcegraph, I spend around 8 hours working on game development.</p><p>I am more determined than ever before, and success or fail - <em>I will try.</em></p><h2 id=c-was-easier-for-me-as-a-beginner-than-c>C was easier for me as a beginner than C++</h2><p>Hacking together games in Raydium&rsquo;s C API taught me that C is hard, but also showed me in retrospect that if I had <em>just a little bit more guidance</em>, If C was just <em>slightly</em> easier, if I only knew the tricks of how to debug C programs: I would have been immensely successful in working with it.</p><p>With Panda3D, writing some decent games in its Python API only to later find I needed to dive into this magical box of a complex C++ core made me believe that:</p><ol><li><strong>C++ is less beginner friendly than C.</strong> One major reason for this is due to the different C++ dialects: you&rsquo;re not going to understand Panda3D C++, or Unreal C++ - by going and reading books about the language or taking a class. They create their own dialects through the language. Today with different C++ versions, even the textbooks and classes you find will be using different dialects.</li><li>There are not good tutorials or explanations online about how game engines work and why. I regularly find that very experienced software engineers and even people who work in Unity or Unreal regularly, simply do not have a decent grasp of how game engines work. &ldquo;What do you mean polygon count is not very important?!&rdquo; are among the most basic questions that arise, with modern game engines abstracting away so many bits that your average developer merely says:</li></ol><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Game engines are just magical ultra-complex things I could never even begin to understand! Only the professional AAA studios and god programmers like Jonathan Blow should even try to do that!&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>I do not subscribe to this belief - and believe that most game developers <em>have been robbed</em> of the proper end-to-end understanding of game engines they deserve.</p><h2 id=unity-is-the-new-flash>Unity is the new Flash</h2><p>You, dear reader, do not understand <em>just how far the bar for game development has been lowered.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj8gt_92c-M"><img class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/114283707-f6b99600-99ff-11eb-82f8-5fd2e2139636.png></a></p><p>Putting together a game in Unity is so beyond ridiculously easy today with Unity that it is incredible, the game engine is truly the new Adobe Flash equivalent.</p><p>You could pick up that engine today, and have a silly little game you yourself put together the next.</p><p>Of course, with Unity, comes large problems for serious game developers:</p><ul><li>There are <em>so many</em> people hacking together Unity games that the quality of the information out there is quite bad.</li><li>The quality of what is on the Unity asset store is quite bad.</li><li>Unity encourages hacking things together to get a quick demo running - and it shows. Game developers hide the fact that they use Unity, because it has such a negative connotation with players that Unity == low quality.</li></ul><h2 id=why-do-we-encourage-building-but-not-understanding>Why do we encourage building, but not understanding?</h2><p>Game engines today are the epitome of <em>large complex code-bases</em>:</p><ul><li>The people and companies working on them value features over quality.</li><li>When there is a major issue, there are few people with an understanding of it to be found.</li><li>Teaching people how to write good software is hard - and that&rsquo;s our customer base (I imagine Unity/Unreal say) - far easier to give them something akin to a scripting language. It&rsquo;s <em>good</em> even if our users don&rsquo;t understand how all of this works.</li></ul><p>Teaching is hard, but if done right is invaluable. There is a reason NeHe Productions' OpenGL tutorials are still revered today: they are incremental, and teach in the form of building blocks on top of what you previously learned.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a reason many AAA studios simply <em>throw out everything</em> and start from scratch when working on their next title.</p><p>We encourage building new things, but not understanding existing things.</p><h2 id=one-language-to-write-your-game-and-engine-in>One language to write your game and engine in</h2><p>Scripting languages for game engines stem from multiple desires - the most common being some variant of:</p><ul><li>C++ is hard, but we need it for performance.</li><li>My level designers can&rsquo;t write C++ code!</li><li>I cannot understand C++, but do know C#/Python/Java/etc.</li></ul><p>A lot of people have a <em>terrible</em> experience from school where they were taught C or C++, had absolutely no understanding of what was going on - and were told &ldquo;This is programming!&rdquo;</p><p>I believe that in general, writing your game in a different language than the engine (Unity&rsquo;s C#/C++ core model, Panda3D&rsquo;s Python/C++ core model, and yes - perhaps even Unreal&rsquo;s <a href=https://blueprintsfromhell.tumblr.com/>Blueprints</a>/C++ core model - which I admit is the better of the three)</p><p><a href=https://blueprintsfromhell.tumblr.com><img class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/114284178-025a8c00-9a03-11eb-8b22-3f7cd6324b31.png></a></p><p>Pictured: The Unreal character controller blueprint for a game called <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1037260/Diacrisis/>Diacrisis</a>.</p><p>Whether you have good code or bad code, good blueprints or bad blueprints - the truth is that having one part of your application in a completely different language <em>creates a significant barrier to learning.</em> I believe that is a bad thing, and the long-term costs outweigh the benefits.</p><h2 id=looking-for-the-one-language-to-rule-them-all>Looking for the one language to rule them all</h2><h3 id=could-rust-be-it>Could Rust be it?</h3><p>Initially, I spent a substantial amount of time considering Rust as that language. It&rsquo;s offer of memory safety guarantees is extremely compelling to me.</p><p>I even convinced us to adopt Rust at Sourcegraph in some form, our syntax highlighter is <a href=https://github.com/sourcegraph/syntect_server>a little Rust HTTP server</a> that was basically write-and-forget. We haven&rsquo;t maintained it at all, and it&rsquo;s held up pretty well for over 5 years.</p><p>But maintaining it has been <em>brutal</em>. We mostly have Go developers there, and despite a strong desire from many of them to learn Rust really none of them have been able to successfully dive into the codebase and get started.</p><p>Rust&rsquo;s learning curve is <em>steep</em>. Steeper than C++ in my view, and definitely steeper than C (despite its many, massive flaws.)</p><p>I spent upwards of 6 months on-and-off trying to become proficient at writing Rust code, and I never really became productive: regularly stumbling across complex issues in downstream dependencies (often used by everyone, but maintained by no one in the rust-lang-nursery.)</p><p><strong>I <em>love</em> the idea of Rust. I love what it promises. And I kept going back to it on-and-off for over 6 months <em>because I truly wanted to be able to be productive in it.</em></strong></p><p>It didn&rsquo;t work. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just not smart enough to use this language&rdquo; I often thought. And I fear this will be the takeaway of many who hear the promise of the language, only to discover another &ldquo;I took a C++ class in school and it was terrible&rdquo; experience, leading so many more developers to conclude &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not good enough for low-level programming, I should learn JavaScript instead&rdquo;.</p><h3 id=could-the-v-language-be-it>Could the V language be it?</h3><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The V language author <a href="https://twitter.com/v_language/status/1382171515924447234?s=20">reached out over Twitter</a> and it would seem my memory was faulty about what happened here, this was due to a misunderstanding almost 100% on my side and I have falsely mis-characterized the V community here as being less friendly then they were in practice, and I am deeply sorry for that.</p><p>I believe my criticisms below about the controversy surrounding the project and the secretive nature <em>when it launched</em> are still valid, and were ultimately major factors in why I chose to not further consider it.</p><p>At the same time, <strong>I want to point out that V does not look the same as when it launched - and anybody who like me left due to those issues may do well <a href=https://vlang.io/>to reconsider it today</a> as the project and details surrounding it appear to have changed substantially.</strong></p><p>What this section originally said was:</p><blockquote><p>When I heard about <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25511073">the V programming language</a>, it seemed right on the spot.</p><p>I immediately jumped into the community to chat with the author, despite the controversy surrounding it - and tried to get more info about it, how he was thinking of the language, etc.</p><p>I asked if there were plans to support raw multi-line string literals, like Go. I was struck by a firm &lsquo;No. Go doesn&rsquo;t have raw string literals either." - it was the unfriendly community I came across, the controversy surrounding it, and the <em>secretive nature of the project</em> (&ldquo;I have this, but I&rsquo;m not going to share it yet&rdquo;) that made me lose faith in its promise.</p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t a language whose community I could join and contribute to.</p></blockquote><h3 id=could-i-build-it>Could I build it?</h3><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic first hit, I thought to myself:</p><blockquote><p>If Go isn&rsquo;t it, Rust isn&rsquo;t it, the V language isn&rsquo;t it - could I build it? Could I create the &ldquo;better C&rdquo; I am looking for? What would it look like?</p></blockquote><p>4 months later, I had a pretty good picture. I had an early stages compiler for the language in Go using LLVM, and knew what I wanted in a &ldquo;better C&rdquo;. There was a <em>long</em> road ahead, but I had a picture of it.
