I probably won&rsquo;t stop.</p><h2 id=the-average-week>The average week</h2><p>I typically spend around:</p><ul><li>48h/week @ <a href=https://sourcegraph.com>day job, Sourcegraph, building developer tools</a></li><li>55h/week <a href=https://github.com/slimsag>coding in Zig</a></li><li>7h/day sleeping</li><li>9h/week caring for self, chores, etc.</li><li>5h/week games or chatting with friends</li></ul><p>Sometimes coding drops to around 80h/week if I feel I need more sleep, time for something else, or if I&rsquo;m just not feeling it.</p><h2 id=my-calendar>My calendar</h2><p>My days are pretty fluid, I don&rsquo;t maintain a strict calendar - but an average week does pretty much look identical to the following. (click to expand)</p><p><a class=imglink href=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/137576033-f7fa007c-db94-4b1c-9d9d-05440da118d7.png><img alt="my calendar" class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/137576033-f7fa007c-db94-4b1c-9d9d-05440da118d7.png></a></p><ul><li>Green is open-source coding in Zig</li><li>Red is time spent at day job</li><li>Yellow is sleep</li><li>Blue is being human</li></ul><h2 id=thats-not-sustainable>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not sustainable&rdquo;</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 2 years now with no issues - if anything, I&rsquo;m more inclined to continue doing it. I like it.</p><p>When I started doing this two years ago, age 25, it was a shift from &ldquo;I work and spend my free time goofing off&rdquo; to &ldquo;I work and spend my free time focusing on what I want to achieve in life&rdquo;.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 1.5 years later that I actually felt comfortable even talking about this publicly or to co-workers. It sounds ridiculous, and what if e.g. I have a bad week at work or something? If I was a manager, I&rsquo;d certainly wonder if it was due to my report doing this (happy to report no issues!)</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href=http://slimsag.com/>coding for nearly 10 years professionally</a>, turning 28 soon. The older I get, the more I seem to enjoy this. It was never an instantaneous shift, but rather a gradual one:</p><p><a class=imglink href=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/137580436-e79a7b21-8aca-4b66-9895-808b8ffa2d38.png><img alt="How my coding has increased to an insane amount over time" class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/137580436-e79a7b21-8aca-4b66-9895-808b8ffa2d38.png></a></p><p>I&rsquo;ve worked at <a href=https://sourcegraph.com>the same startup</a> for the past ~7 years - and I&rsquo;ve certainly experienced early-stage startup lifestyle - with all the crunch that comes with that.</p><p>So it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve just never experienced conditions that <em>should lead to burnout before</em>-it&rsquo;s just that <em>I&rsquo;m not sure I truly understand what people mean when they say burnout</em>. I think it might often be used to express a feeling of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no longer interested in the work I do at my tech job, but I like the benefits and I&rsquo;m paid stupid amounts of money - so saying that feels weird! What do I do?&rdquo; - and I just haven&rsquo;t been in that situation before.</p><h2 id=youre-going-to-burnout>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to burnout&rdquo;</h2><p>I hear this from people who often bring me other <em>grumbling messages of distaste and hatred</em> (hello /r/programmingcirclejerk! ðŸ˜ƒ happy to say I&rsquo;m a lurker these days and get much enjoyment from you.)</p><p>I think you&rsquo;ve just misunderstand, though.</p><p><a class=imglink href=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/137581300-987f4272-79f0-444c-a0e3-007474cb1f5b.png><img alt="Normal people vs. me: kids/family/fun vs. coding" class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/137581300-987f4272-79f0-444c-a0e3-007474cb1f5b.png></a></p><p>If you have children or a significant other, think how much time you spend with them. Do you get burnt out from it? I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that you take breaks from time to time, but I think most would say no.</p><p>Now replace you children or significant other with a high-stress environment - let&rsquo;s say you spend the same amount of time with co-workers instead of your kids or significant other. That&rsquo;s some nightmare fuel!</p><p>This is analogous to how I feel: If I was working 100h/week at my day job, I would <em>absolutely</em> burn out. I think that&rsquo;s what people hear when I say this. But that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m doing: I work a regular programming day job like everyone else - it&rsquo;s at a late-stage, fairly relaxed startup and with a good work/life balance. It&rsquo;s just that I choose to spend the &ldquo;life&rdquo; part of that balance doing what I truly love: coding towards some serious aspirations.</p><h2 id=nobody-is-productive-writing-code-that-long>&ldquo;Nobody is productive writing code that long&rdquo;</h2><p><em>Working on the right problem to take advantage of your current metal state</em> is how you make true progress. Or, at least, that&rsquo;s how I see it:</p><p><a class=imglink href=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/137578255-ab0087e7-f552-44e5-987a-4cfdc2caef8f.png><img alt="What I work on depending on mental state" class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/137578255-ab0087e7-f552-44e5-987a-4cfdc2caef8f.png></a></p><p>But &ldquo;how one could have so many projects lined up, enough to make switching between them always an option?&rdquo; that&rsquo;s because I have some lofty life goals (or an addiction to trying to attain the unattainable, I&rsquo;ll let you choose.)</p><p>I&rsquo;m working double-time on a secret ten-year vision to upend the gaming industry. Part of that includes a commitment I&rsquo;ve made to build the following in Zig:</p><ul><li>A <a href=https://github.com/hexops/mach>game engine for the future</a></li><li>Better developer tools (not just for game developers)</li><li>Several real video games, which I believe can be competitive with what AAA studios offer today.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m delusional about how hard that will be: I spent <a href=http://azul3d.org>4 years previously writing a game engine in Go</a>. I spent the last 7 years of my life working on developer tools at Sourcegraph. I spent most of my teenage years completely failing to create video games in various game engines.</p><p>I know how hard and time consuming it is. My vision requires only time and diligence.</p><h2 id=you-dont-have-a-life>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have a life&rdquo;</h2><p>We all choose the life we love, and I enjoy the heck out of mine. Grew up in a family of 6 - we laugh together because we all know my life choices are crazy (who adopts 9 cats? yes I&rsquo;m <em>that person</em> too.)</p><p>It&rsquo;s absolutely not normal; but it&rsquo;s also probably far from the &ldquo;lone 20 year old in a basement who has not showered for weeks and is anti-social&rdquo; that you&rsquo;re picturing.</p><p>I do spend time with family, and recently my new nephew. I chat with friends online, I play games every week. I go to the dentist, I take care of myself. I take care of my cats, and spoil them in ways you can&rsquo;t really fathom.</p><p>The reason I can spend so much time doing what I love is because:</p><ul><li>I don&rsquo;t have kids, nor a significant other. That&rsquo;s a tradeoff.</li><li>I get groceries delivered, I&rsquo;d rather spend the time coding.</li><li>I make sure I have deep technical problems I need to think through and solve, and solve it <em>while</em> I am making meals, eating, or doing chores.</li><li>I run 6 miles many days of the week to keep healthy. I do it while writing code, using a standing desk treadmill.</li></ul><p>Most of my time is spent in a large, luxurious ~2500 sq/ft home. Just me and my 9 cats all living like monarchs, cozy and coding away at my dreams.</p><p>I regret nothing. If I die this way, I&rsquo;d go out happy.</p><h2 id=thats-not-healthy>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not healthy&rdquo;</h2><p>It&rsquo;s completely 100% OK if at this point you&rsquo;re just feeling a bit like:</p><p><a class=imglink href=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/137579019-f8313501-5024-48db-83e6-2abe30c78337.png><img height=250px alt="Well I don't like that" class=color src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/137579019-f8313501-5024-48db-83e6-2abe30c78337.png></a></p><p>I know this lifestyle isn&rsquo;t for everyone. It&rsquo;s not for you.</p><p>And I don&rsquo;t think it makes me &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; (in a better-than-you way). I&rsquo;m just a people, struggling with a very different lifestyle than you.</p><p>I feel strongly you should never feel <em>compelled</em> or <em>required</em> to do what I am doing. Any company, manager, or person asking you to do so is <em>horrible</em> and you should get out quick. I don&rsquo;t want to contribute to that culture or feed it.</p><p>But-I love what I&rsquo;m doing. I love the amount of progress I&rsquo;m able to achieve every day. I love my time spent solving problems. I love <a href=http://slimsag.com>what I&rsquo;ve achieved so far</a>. I want to go further than ever before - I&rsquo;ve been marathon coding for as long as I can remember, and I&rsquo;m not going to stop. I <em>need</em> to see how far I can go.</p><p>I love the choices I&rsquo;ve made in life. I hope you love yours too.</p><h2 id=thanks-for-reading>Thanks for reading</h2><p>Please send your hate to <a href=https://twitter.com/slimsag>@slimsag</a> on Twitter or to the comments section wherever this ends up, I&rsquo;ll see you there! ðŸ˜‰</p><p>If you liked this, you might also like:</p><ul><li><a href=2021-04-10-increasing-my-contribution-to-zig-to-200-a-month.md>My game development journey & why I&rsquo;m increasing my contribution to Zig to $200/mo</a></li></ul></div></main><script>function addAnchor(a){a.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin',`<a href="#${a.id}" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> `)}document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var a=document.querySelectorAll('h1[id], h2[id], h3[id], h4[id]');a&&a.forEach(addAnchor)})</script></div><div class=footer><div class=row-1><a href=https://hexops.com/privacy>Privacy matters</a>
